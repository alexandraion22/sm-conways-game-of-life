Elapsed Time: 22.434s
    IPC: 1.685
    Average CPU Frequency: 3.360 GHz
Logical Core Utilization: 4.5% (1.431 out of 32)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step
 | and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in some cases
 | can improve processor throughput and overall performance of multi-threaded
 | applications.
 |
    Physical Core Utilization: 8.9% (1.429 out of 16)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Run the HPC Performance Characterization analysis to estimate the
     | efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and Waits
     | analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
     |
Microarchitecture Usage: 43.2% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.
 | 
 | Possible cause: memory stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction
 | or long latency instructions.
 | 
 | Next steps: Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to identify the cause
 | of the low microarchitecture usage efficiency.

    Retiring: 43.2% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 4.2% of Pipeline Slots
        Front-End Latency: 1.4% of Pipeline Slots
        Front-End Bandwidth: 2.8% of Pipeline Slots
    Bad Speculation: 19.9% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant proportion of pipeline slots containing useful work are
     | being cancelled. This can be caused by mispredicting branches or by
     | machine clears. Note that this metric value may be highlighted due to
     | Branch Resteers issue.
     |
    Back-End Bound: 32.7% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).

        Memory Bound: 19.9% of Pipeline Slots
            L1 Bound: 12.3% of Clockticks

            Store Bound: 7.6% of Clockticks
        Core Bound: 12.9% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
